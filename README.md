<h1>Error while uploading a media from wp-admin</h1>
<p>If you face something like this:
Unable to create directory uploads/2016/11. Is its parent directory writable by the server?

Generally we think this could be a permission issue,but not like that.
just go in your admin, go to Settings/Media and change the upload path to that of the new server. (Keep it default)
